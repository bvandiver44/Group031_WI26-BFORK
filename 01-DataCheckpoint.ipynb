        "Within the National Basketball Association (NBA), the standard 82-game regular season involves a high density of competition interspersed with frequent transmeridian travel, creating a unique environment where athletic performance is perpetually modulated by recovery status and circadian alignment.\n",
        "\n",
        "Travel stress in this context is characterized by two distinct but overlapping phenomena: travel fatigue—the acute exhaustion from the logistics of movement—and jet lag, a circadian rhythm disorder caused by crossing multiple time zones. This biological asymmetry is critical, as the human circadian system is naturally more adept at adapting to westward travel (phase delay) than shortening its cycle through eastward travel (phase advance) <a name=\"cite_note-1\"></a><sup>1</sup>.\n",
        "\n",
        "Research indicates that sleep disruption is the primary mechanism through which travel stress erodes performance. On the first night after travel, athletes experience a predictable reduction in sleep duration based on the number of time zones crossed, with eastward travel being significantly more disruptive (averaging -24.5 minutes) than westward travel <a name=\"cite_note-2\"></a><sup>2</sup>.\n",
        "\n",
        "These disruptions can manifest as significant decrements in Offensive Efficiency (OE), a holistic metric that measures scoring effectiveness per possession. Specifically, studies have shown that eastward jet lag is associated with a 1.2% decrease in Effective Field Goal Percentage ($eFG\\%$) differential <a name=\"cite_note-3\"></a><sup>3</sup>.\n",
        "\n",
        "Furthermore, mental fatigue disrupts psychomotor vigilance, essential for shooting accuracy and ball security, often leading to a rise in turnover rates (TOV%) at the end of long road trips.\n",
        "\n",
        "Existing literature has also identified specific \"tipping points\" where travel fatigue becomes the dominant predictor of performance variance. One of the most robust findings is that cumulative time zone changes of three or more within a three-day period are significantly detrimental to performance <a name=\"cite_note-4\"></a><sup>4</sup>.\n",
        "\n",
        "Additionally, the back-to-back game scenario remains the most consistent predictor of decline; visiting teams playing on the second night of a back-to-back win only about 36% of the time.\n",
        "\n",
        "While total mileage is a factor, its impact is most severe when combined with the duration of a multi-city tour, as the cumulative stress of changing environments leads to a measurable decline in $eFG\\%$.\n",
        "\n",
        "To capture these complex, non-linear interactions, modern sports analytics projects have increasingly moved from simple linear models toward advanced techniques like Random Forests and Gradient Boosting (LightGBM) to accurately identify and predict the \"fatigue tax\" <a name=\"cite_note-5\"></a><sup>5</sup>.\n",

Normal values for healthy individuals range from 70 to 100 mg/dL.  Values 100-125 are prediabetic and values >125mg/dL indicate diabetes. Values <70 indicate hypoglycemia. Fasting idicates the patient hasn't eaten in the last 8 hours.  If blood glucose is >250 or <50 at any time (regardless of the time of last meal) the patient's life may be in immediate danger\"\n",

This sample is likely biased because of that self-selection. These people own smartphones and may be healthier and may have more disposable income than the average person.
